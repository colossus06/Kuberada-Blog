# Day 4: Application Design and Build - Laying the Foundation

Welcome back, CKAD champions! 

Today, we delve into the first core domain of the CKAD exam: **Application Design and Build**. This is where you'll showcase your ability to design, build, and configure Kubernetes objects to support scalable and resilient applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Building Blocks of Kubernetes Applications

* **Pods:** The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, housing one or more containers.
* **Deployments:** Manage the desired state of your Pods, ensuring they're running and available.
* **Services:**  Expose your applications to the network, enabling internal and external access.
* **ConfigMaps & Secrets:** Store configuration data and sensitive information securely.
* **Persistent Volumes & Claims:** Provide persistent storage for your applications, ensuring data survives pod restarts or failures.

## üìê Designing for Success

* **Stateless vs. Stateful:** Understand the differences and when to use each approach.
* **Scaling:** Design applications that can scale horizontally to handle increased load.
* **Resiliency:** Implement strategies for handling failures and ensuring high availability.
* **Security:**  Consider security best practices throughout the design process.

## üõ†Ô∏è  Key Skills for Day 4

* **Creating Kubernetes manifests (YAML):**  You'll need to be proficient in writing YAML files to define your Kubernetes objects.
* **Using `kubectl`:** Master the `kubectl` command-line tool for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster.
* **Building and Modifying Container Images:** Understand how to create and update container images using tools like Docker.
* **Choosing the Right Workload Resource:**  Know when to use Deployments, DaemonSets, CronJobs, and other workload types.
* **Multi-Container Pod Design Patterns:**  Implement sidecar containers, init containers, and other patterns to enhance your application's functionality.
* **Utilizing Persistent and Ephemeral Volumes:** Understand how to provision and use different types of storage for your applications.

## üìö Essential Resources:

* **Kubernetes Documentation - Pods:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Deployments:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Services:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - ConfigMaps:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Secrets:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Persistent Volumes:**  [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Today's Action:

1. ‚úÖ  **Deep Dive into the Docs:**  Explore the Kubernetes documentation on the topics listed above. Pay close attention to the practical examples and use cases. 
2. ‚úÖ  **Hands-On Lab:**  Complete a lab that involves building and modifying a container image, deploying it using different workload types, and configuring persistent storage. Embrace the challenge and remember, every hands-on experience brings you one step closer to mastering Kubernetes!
3. ‚úÖ **Share Your Progress:**  Post a summary of your key learnings or any challenges you encountered on social media using the hashtag `#CKADSprint`. Let's celebrate your wins and support each other through the tough spots.

**Remember:** 

* The CKAD exam is hands-on, so the more you practice, the more confident you'll become. 
* Don't hesitate to ask questions or share your struggles with the community. We're all in this together!
* Celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Every step counts! 

**Up next on Day 5:** Master Kubernetes deployments for smooth, reliable application rollouts. This domain carries a significant 20% weightage, so get ready!
