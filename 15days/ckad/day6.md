# üéØ  Day 6: Application Observability and Maintenance -  Keeping Your Apps Healthy (15% Exam Weight)

Welcome back, CKAD champions! Today, we're tackling the third core domain of the exam: Application Observability and Maintenance. This domain is all about ensuring your applications are running smoothly, identifying and troubleshooting issues, and keeping them in tip-top shape.

## ü©∫ The Importance of Observability

In the world of Kubernetes, things can go wrong. Pods might crash, deployments might fail, and network issues can arise. That's why observability is key. You need to be able to see what's happening inside your cluster, identify problems quickly, and take corrective action.

## üõ†Ô∏è  Key Skills for Day 6

* **Understanding API deprecations:**  Kubernetes is constantly evolving, and APIs can become deprecated. You need to know how to identify deprecated APIs and migrate to newer versions.
* **Implementing probes and health checks:** Liveness and readiness probes are essential for ensuring your applications are healthy and ready to serve traffic.
* **Using built-in CLI tools for monitoring:**  `kubectl` provides several commands for monitoring your applications, such as `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, and `kubectl logs`.
* **Utilizing container logs:** Container logs provide valuable insights into the behavior of your applications. You need to know how to access and analyze them.
* **Debugging in Kubernetes:**  When things go wrong, you need to be able to troubleshoot and debug your applications effectively.

## üìö Essential Resources:

* **Kubernetes Documentation - API Deprecations:**  [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Probes:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Monitoring:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-cluster/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-cluster/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Logging:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Debugging:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-pod-replication-controller/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-pod-replication-controller/)

## üí°  Pro Tips:

* **Practice troubleshooting scenarios:** Set up a local Kubernetes cluster and intentionally introduce errors or failures. Practice using `kubectl` and container logs to identify and resolve the issues.
* **Familiarize yourself with common error messages:** Knowing how to interpret common Kubernetes error messages can save you valuable time during the exam.
* **Use monitoring tools:** In real-world scenarios, you'll likely use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gain deeper insights into your applications. While not required for the CKAD, familiarity with these tools can be beneficial.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Today's Action:

1. **Deep Dive into the Docs:**  Explore the Kubernetes documentation on the topics listed above. Pay close attention to the practical examples and use cases.
2. **Hands-On Labs:**  Complete labs that focus on implementing probes, monitoring applications with `kubectl`, analyzing container logs, and debugging common Kubernetes issues.
3. **Share Your Progress:**  Post a screenshot of your favorite `kubectl` command for troubleshooting on social media using the hashtag `#CKADSprint`. Let's see which commands are your go-to tools for keeping those applications healthy!

Let's sharpen your observability and maintenance skills today!

**Up next on Day 7:**  We'll tackle the Application Environment, Configuration, and Security domain, ensuring your applications are not only functional but also secure.
