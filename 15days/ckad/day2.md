## üéØ Day 2: Exam Logistics and Setup - Prepare for Battle

Welcome back to the CKAD Sprint!  Today, we're ditching Kubernetes commands for a moment and focusing on the practical side of things: the exam logistics and the setup you'll need to ace it.

*You can track your progress with [CKAD Sprint Tracker](#tracker).*


## üìã Exam Logistics - No Surprises Allowed

Let's make sure you're fully prepped on the administrative side of things:

* **Technical Requirements:** Your computer and internet connection are your battle stations.  Double-check they meet the Linux Foundation's specific criteria. **We're talking [operating system requirements](https://helpdesk.psionline.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4409608794260--PSI-Bridge-FAQ-System-Requirements), browser, webcam, microphone - the whole nine yards.** Don't let a technical hiccup derail your focus on exam day.
* **Exam Registration:**  Haven't registered yet? No sweat, you need to register at least 24 hours before your chosen exam time. 
* **Exam Rules and Regulations:** Ignorance is *not* bliss here.  Understand the rules around allowed resources, breaks, and behavior during the exam. A little knowledge now prevents a lot of heartache later.
* **Proctoring:**  You'll be monitored online throughout the exam. We'll discuss what this means, how to prepare, and tips for a smooth proctoring experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Optimize for Focus

Your physical environment matters. 

Let's create a [space that minimizes distractions and maximizes your performance](<https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/skillcreds-faq#what-are-the-testing-environment-requirements-to-take-the-exam:~:text=sync%2C%20dropbox%2C%20BitTorrent)-,What%20are%20the%20Testing%20Environment%20requirements%20to%20take%20the%20exam%3F,-Below%20are%20the>):

* **Workspace:** Find a quiet corner where you won't be interrupted.  Ideally, a dedicated space just for your exam. 
* **Ergonomics:**  Comfort is key for a 2-hour exam. Ensure your chair, desk, and monitor setup won't leave you aching halfway through.
* **Equipment:**  Make sure your computer is up to the task.  Check your keyboard and mouse too ‚Äì you'll be relying on them heavily.
* **Distraction-Free Zone:** This is *your* time. Silence your phone, close those tempting browser tabs, and let others know you're in the zone.
* **Camera and Lighting**: Make sure your webcam is positioned correctly and the lighting is adequate for the proctor to see you clearly.
* **ID requirements**: Ensure you have an [ID that meets the requirements](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/tips-cka-and-ckad#:~:text=during%20the%20exam-,ID%20Requirements%20to%20take%20the%20Exam,-Candidates%20need%20to).
