# üéØ  Day 6: Application Observability and Maintenance -  Keeping Your Apps Healthy (15% Exam Weight)

### Day 7: Application Environment, Configuration, and Security - Part 1: Extending & Securing Kubernetes (25% Exam Weight)

Welcome to Day 7 of the CKAD sprint, where we dive deep into the crucial realm of Application Environment, Configuration, and Security. This domain spans two days, so buckle up for an intensive exploration of how to make your Kubernetes applications not just functional, but also robust and secure.

*You can track your progress with [CKAD Sprint Tracker](#tracker).*

## üîê Today's Focus: Extending and Securing Kubernetes

On Day 7, we'll zero in on two key aspects:

* **Extending Kubernetes:** Kubernetes is incredibly powerful out-of-the-box, but sometimes you need to go beyond its built-in capabilities. We'll explore how Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators let you tailor Kubernetes to your specific needs, opening up a world of possibilities for managing complex applications.
* **Security Fundamentals:**  Kubernetes security is non-negotiable. We'll lay the groundwork for protecting your cluster and applications by understanding authentication, authorization, and admission control mechanisms. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills for Day 7

* **Discovering and using CRDs:** Learn how to define and use custom resources to extend Kubernetes' functionality.
* **Understanding Operators:**  Grasp the concept of Operators and how they automate the management of complex applications.
* **Mastering Authentication and Authorization:**  Understand how Kubernetes controls access to the cluster and its resources.
* **Implementing Admission Control:** Explore how admission controllers can enforce policies and validate requests before they're processed.

## üìö Essential Resources:

* **Kubernetes Documentation - CRDs:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Operators:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Access Control:**  [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/)
* **Kubernetes Documentation - Admission Controllers:** [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/)

## üí°  Pro Tips:

* **Explore Real-World CRDs and Operators:**  Research popular CRDs and Operators used in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This will give you a better understanding of their practical applications.
* **Practice RBAC Configuration:** Set up Role-Based Access Control in your local cluster to experiment with different permission levels.
* **Understand the Security Implications:**  Consider the security implications of every decision you make when configuring your Kubernetes environment.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Today's Action:

1. **Deep Dive into the Docs:** Explore the Kubernetes documentation on CRDs, Operators, Authentication, Authorization, and Admission Control. Pay close attention to the practical examples and use cases.
2. **Hands-On Labs:** Complete labs that focus on creating and using CRDs, configuring RBAC, and exploring different admission controllers.
3. **Share Your "Aha!" Moment:** Post on social media about one key insight you gained today regarding extending or securing Kubernetes. Use the hashtag `#CKADSprint`.

Let's fortify your Kubernetes knowledge and build a secure foundation for your applications!
