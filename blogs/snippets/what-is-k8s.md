K8s, is the shorthand term for Kubernetes ‚Äì the ultimate multitasker for managing containerized applications.

It simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications when it is the right solution. 
We are studying for CKA and CKAD (CKS needs to wait for now üê≤). 

That brings us to the conclusion that we will work on a lot of K8s hands-on articles. Some will be production use cases, real world scenarios and some will be domain focused.
