In this guide, we'll walk through setting up ArgoCD on your AKS cluster. By the end of this hands-on tutorial, you'll have an AKS cluster with an ArgoCD instance monitoring any changes in the repository you've set up, along with the necessary secrets. The demo uses a simple nginx deployment and service file instead of a Python application. You can find the deployment URL in the provided gist. Since the repository is public, you can skip setting up a repository secret. Let's get started quickly!

**Prerequisites:**

- An existing Azure subscription with AKS cluster creation permissions
- Azure CLI installed and configured with your subscription
- kubectl configured to access your AKS cluster
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts

**Creating the AKS Cluster:**

If you don't have an AKS cluster, you can create one using the Azure CLI or terraform. Refer to [Microsoft's documentation](assets/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) for detailed instructions.

While this guide focuses on deploying ArgoCD on an existing AKS cluster, you can spin up a minikube, k3d cluster too. If you don't have one, you can easily create one using the Azure CLI or the terraform code we store on https://github.com/colossus06/Kuberada-Blog-Labs/tree/main/argocd.

## Installing ArgoCD on AKS

1. **Download the ArgoCD Manifest:**


Start by downloading the ArgoCD manifest file from the [ArgoCD repository](assets/https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/install.yaml).

  ```sh
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
  ```

2. **Configure ArgoCD:**

Rename the `install.yaml` file to `argo-cm-nodeport.yaml` and configure ArgoCD for your environment:

- Disable TLS and configure insecure connection:

  ```sh
  data:
    server.insecure: "true"
  ```

- Change the `argocd-server` service type to NodePort:

  ```sh
  spec:
    type: NodePort
  ```

3. **Connect SCM and ArgoCD:**

Since we are using a private repo, we need to create a secret to authenticate with your private Git repository. If you're using the sample nginx manifest file, you can safely skip this step.


4. **Deploy ArgoCD:**

Apply the modified `argo-cm-nodeport.yaml` file and the secret to deploy ArgoCD:

5. **Access the ArgoCD UI:**

Open the ArgoCD UI using port forwarding:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

Access the UI at `http://localhost:8080` and log in with the default username admin and password you get with following the gist.

6. **Validation**

As you can see, repo and application is already setup and the status is healthy. We didn't interact with the cluster directly instead delegated out github repo as the single source of truth.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up ArgoCD on your AKS cluster. Now you can deploy your applications with ease using GitOps principles.
