Did you happen to receive an email notification from GitLab starting with "namespace has 5% or less Shared Runner Pipeline minutes remaining" üòÑ? This email underscores the criticality of managing your Shared Runner Pipeline minutes. To optimize your CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) processes, it's crucial to understand and utilize GitLab Runners effectively.

## GitLab Runner Types

GitLab Runners come in two types: **Specific Runners** and **Shared Runners**.

**Specific Runners** are dedicated to a single project and can only run jobs for that specific project. Conversely, **Shared Runners** are available to all projects within a GitLab instance, providing a versatile and shared resource for CI/CD processes.

## Locating GitLab Runner

To locate GitLab Runner in your GitLab account, follow these steps:

1. Open your GitLab account and navigate to **Settings**.

2. In the Settings menu, find the **CI/CD** section.

3. Expand the **Runners** section.

Now that we know where to find the runners, let's proceed with the installation.

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### Step 1 - Install `gitlab-runner.exe`

Open PowerShell with administrative privileges and execute the following commands:

```powershell
# Create a folder for GitLab Runner
New-Item -Path 'C:\GitLab-Runner' -ItemType Directory

# Change to the folder
cd 'C:\GitLab-Runner'

# Download GitLab Runner binary
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "gitlab-runner.exe"

# Register and start the runner
.\gitlab-runner.exe install
.\gitlab-runner.exe start
```

### Step 2 - Register the Runner

Open a command prompt, navigate to the GitLab Runner folder, and execute the following:

```powershell
Win + r
cmd
cd GitLab-Runner
.\gitlab-runner.exe register --url https://gitlab.com --token <token>
```

Ensure you allow the necessary permissions if prompted.

Provide a name for the runner (e.g., `<your-name>`) and choose the executor as "shell."

**Expected output:**

Runner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's running already, the config should be automatically reloaded!

Configuration (with the authentication token) was saved in "C:\\GitLab-Runner\\config.toml"


## Activating Runner

To activate the runner and start picking up jobs, run the following commands:

```powershell
Win + r
cmd
cd GitLab-Runner
.\gitlab-runner.exe run
```

Upon successful activation, navigate to **Settings > CI/CD > Runners** in your GitLab account to verify the newly configured runner.
