# About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gulcan, a DevOps and Kubernetes enthusiast who loves automation, scripting, and solving real-world problems. 

If there's a challenge, I'm probably already tinkering with a solution.

## What I Do

- I enjoy tackling challenges with Kubernetes

- Why do something manually when you can automate it?

- Security is always included, never optional.

Join me on this journey of continuous learning and solving some puzzles.
