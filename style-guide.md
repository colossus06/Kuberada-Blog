# Style Guide for Kuberada

Welcome to the Kuberada Style Guide! To ensure consistency and clarity in our documentation, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use Angle Brackets for Placeholders:**
   When indicating placeholders, use angle brackets (`< >`) to clearly signify variables. Provide explanatory context to help users understand the purpose of the placeholder.

   Example:

   ```bash
   k3d cluster create <yourk3dcluster>
   ```

   Here, `<yourk3dcluster>` is a placeholder. Be sure to explain what it represents, giving users a clear understanding of the input they should provide.

2. **Use "You" Language:**
   Communicate directly with the user by employing "you" language. This makes it more relatable and easy to follow.

3. **Be Concise:**

    Opt for brevity to convey information efficiently. If you can tell something with 3 words instead of 8, then go for it. 
    Simplicity is key for an enhanced user experience.
